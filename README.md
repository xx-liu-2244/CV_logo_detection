## Fine-Tuning with Keras

#### 1. Data
* Resize
* Standardizing/Normalization
* Data augumentation: Logos might not be symmetric, consider rotation/resize than overturn

#### 2. Build the Model
* Base model/pre-trained model selection:

* Complie new layers, rescale-basemodel-pooling-dropout-dense 

#### 3. Train and Fine-Tuning
* try different top-layer inclusion


# ROBOFLOW
By Domenique: I registered using my institutional mail and it gives me the possibility to upload up to 10k images.

#1. In a new LogoDet project, Upload the annot_train.csv file 

#2. Upload only the train folder with images (coordinate with the others: upload only the images that were not already processed by someone else. I put the first 10k of train). Choose the option 100% training:

#3. Wait for the infinite-time-consuming upload: for me, 9851 images out of 10k were uploaded as the remaining ones did not have a correspondence in the csv file.

#4. Generate a new version of the dataset, including the following pre-processing and augmentation steps:

#5. Click on Generate and wait. Give a name as: first 10k, second 10k augmented, etcâ€¦

#6. Download the dataset choosing the most convenient format:
(For me, Tensorflow Object Detection would lead to restart my pc over and over so I still did not discover what will be the format)
